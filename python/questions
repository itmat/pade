We currently pick one of the conditions as a reference, and report all
genes as up- or down- regulated with respect to that condition. Is
this still the way we would do it when we use ANOVA? Would we instead
be reporting genes that or up- or down- regulated against the
background levels?

We can simplify a lot of the code by changing the functions to only
compute up-regulated genes, and then just run it with the conditions
switched to get down-regulated ones.
