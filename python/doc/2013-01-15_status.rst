---------
Completed
---------

* Initialize "schema" to describe columns in input file
* Group columns according to "full" and "reduced" models
* Compute means and coefficients using full model
* Bootstrap using artificial data sets constructed by adding sampled residuals to predicted values
* Compute distribution of f-test values over sampled data
* Use that to compute confidence score associated with each value of f-test
* Framework for searching over range of constant "tuning parameters"
  for optimal value for each confidence level
* Print paginated HTML report for each confidence level

-----------
Outstanding
-----------

* Support "marginal" model (e.g. {\tt sex + treatment}, no interaction term)
* Add t-test back in?
* Support logged input data?
* Support missing values in input data?
* Come up with formula for tuning parameters to search over?
* Distribute work?
* Save output and intermediate files as raw text

-------------------
Performance metrics
-------------------

* Ran Perl version and latest Python version on input file with 2 classes, 4 replicates per class, so 8 samples total.
* Tried exponentially increasing number of features in input file
* Capture running time and memory usage
* Older version does 70 permutations, newer does 1,000 randomized samples.
