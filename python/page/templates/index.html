    <h2>Num. features by confidence level</h2>

    <p>
      This shows the number of features differentially expressed (up
      and down separately) at each confidence level, for each
      class. Up-regulated lines have upward pointing triangle markers,
      and down-regulated lines have downward pointing triangles.

    <h2>Summary by confidence level</h2>
      
    <p>
      These tables show the number of features that are up- and down-
      regulated at each confidence level. One table per condition. The
      count for each condition and confidence level is based on the
      value of &alpha; that maximizes the number of features chosen at
      that confidence level for that condition.

    <h2>Detail by confidence level</h2>

    <p>
      Each page gives a table of all the features that are
      differentially expressed, up or down, in any class at the given
      confidence level.
