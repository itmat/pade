# This sets all of the factors for all columns that represent samples.
# You should fill out this section to set each factor for each sample.
# For example, if you had a sample called sample1 that recieved some
# kind of treatment, and one called sample2 that did not, you might
# have:

# sample_factor_mapping:
#   sample1:
#     treated: yes
#   sample2:
#     treated: no
