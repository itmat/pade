<h2>PaGE_5.1 Documentation - the <tt>--paired</tt> command</h2>
<p>
This concept is best illustrated by example.  Suppose that two tissue types, type 1 and type 2, are assayed from several different animals.  Suppose that a gene is two-fold higher in tissue type 2 than in tissue type 1, but that its intensity level differs greatly from animal to animal.  So for example in animal 1 it might be 10 in tissue 1 and 20 in tissue 2, while in animal 2 it is 100 in tissue 1 and 200 in tissue 2.  It is a consistently two-fold change in each animal, however this gene might only be found by an approrpriate paired analysis.  This is because as unpaired data it has very large variance.  
<p>
If your data is naturally paired and you suspect an effect of this type, then set this option.

<b>Note 1</b>: Both one-channel and two-channel data can be paired.  But "paired" makes no sense in the case of a <a href="commandinfo_design.html">direct comparison design</a>.<br>
<b>Note 2</b>: If using the <tt><a href="commandinfo_tstat.html">--tstat</a></tt> option together with the <tt>--paired</tt> option, the 2-sample <i>t</i>-statistic is replaced by the 1-sample <i>t</i>-statistic.   If using the <tt><a href="commandinfo_means.html">--means</a></tt> option with the <tt>--paired</tt> option then the ratio of the means is replaced by the geometric mean of the ratios of the paired intensities.  See <tt><a href="commandinfo_tstat.html">--tstat</a></tt> and <tt><a href="commandinfo_means.html">--means</a></tt> for more details on the statistics.<br>
<b>Note 3</b>: A different permutation scheme is used in the paired case as opposed to the unpaired case.  See <tt><a href="commandinfo_num_permutations.html">--num_permutations</a></tt> for more details on the permutation schemes..
