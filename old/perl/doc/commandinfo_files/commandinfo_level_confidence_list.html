<h2>PaGE_5.1 Documentation - the <tt>--level_confidence_list</tt> command</h2>
<p>
If you have more than two conditions, so you will have patterns of length two or longer, then you can set the level_confidence separately for each position in the pattern.  
<p>
The level_confidence_list is a comma delimited list of confidences, one for each position in the pattern.  Do not include any white-space in this list.
<p>
<DIV CLASS="nounderline">
<b>Note</b>: If you have more than two conditions and you use <tt><a href="commandinfo_level_confidence.html">--level_confidence</a></tt> then that confidence will be applied to all positions in the pattern.

<p>
This command takes one argument of type string, which must be a comma separated list of floats between 0 and 1.

<h3>Example: 
</h3>
<pre>
> perl PaGE_5.1.6.pl --level_confidence_list .8,.6,.95
