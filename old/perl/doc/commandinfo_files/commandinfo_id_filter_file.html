<h2>PaGE_5.1 Documentation - the <tt>--id_filter_file</tt> command</h2>
<p>
Use this command to give the name of a file which contains ID's, one per line.  If this file is specified with the --id_filter_file command then only the rows in your data file with these ID's will be considered.  This is useful in case you want to look at various subsets of genes and do not want to reparse your entire data file.
<p>
This command takes one argument of type string.

<p>
<b>Note:</b> It is important to be careful about the subsets used as it can bias the confidence measures.  
<ul>
<li>It is okay to choose a subest based on biological function or some other biological characterization.
<li>It is not appropriate to choose a subest of genes based on some statistical criteria, such as only genes with small variance, or only genes which show differential expression.  
</ul>


<h3>Example: This includes the file named "my_ids".
</h3>
<pre>
> perl PaGE_5.1.6.pl --id_filter_file my_ids
</pre>

Example of what the file my_ids might look like:

<pre>
G1
G4
G15
G33
G97
...
</pre>
